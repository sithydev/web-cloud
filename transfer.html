<h2 style="text-align: center;">Transfer "Dreams" to "Hexes"</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Since SITHFUN Cloud is now Hexagon, there are now new save files names. On SITHFUN Cloud, the file names were for example "file.dream". But now on Hexagon, they are "file.hex". You can upload your .dream files to this website to transfer them into .hex files if you downloaded them before this change. You can also do it manually by clicking <a href="https://sithydev.github.io/web-cloud/transferyourself">HERE</a>.</p>
