<h2 style="text-align: center;">Transfer "Dreams" to "Hexes" yourself</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">So it's not that simple. You'll need to open your .dream file and replace all "dr" with "hx", you need to change the line at 198 from "sfcloud.sidex" to "sfcloud2.sidex", you need to change the last line (1927) from "saveSystem" to "hexSaves". That's it. This is what you just did...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You changed the main file from "DR (Dream)" to "HX (Hex)".<br />You changed the store location from "SFCloud" to "SFCloud2".<br />You changed the main saving system from "saveSystem (Old)" to "hexSaves (New)".</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The reason we use SFCloud2 instead of something like just "StoreHex", is because it would ruin the old Dream files so old Dreams wouldnt have been able to be uploaded and viewed on Hexagon. We could have just implemented this feature in every single Dream, but do you really think we couldve edited 19283 files? No.</p>
